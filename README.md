# Dynamic-cooling-system-to-minimize-packet-loss
a repository that has the codes for a dynamic cooling system to minimize packet loss
The implementation of server.py is done in a Raspberry Pi model 4b connected to a laptop using ssh 
putty was used to run the ssh on a laptop
hardware implementation was done using a Arduino Uno, a brushless DC fan with pulse width modulation, a temperature sensor using a 10k thermistor and a 10k resistor, a DHT module for ambient temp analysis,
